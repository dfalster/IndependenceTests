\description{
The tests are constructed from the \enc{MÃ¶bius}{Mobius} transformation
applied to the probability cells in a multi-way contingency table. The
Pearson chi-squared test of mutual independence is partitioned into
A-dependence statistics over all subsets A of variables. The goal of the
partition is to identify subsets of dependent variables when the mutual
independence hypothesis is rejected by the Pearson chi-squared test. The
methodology can be directly adapted to test for serial independence of d
successive observations of a stationary categorical time series.
}
\details{
For categorical time series,
especially those of a nominal (non ordinal) nature, the user should be
aware that tests of serial independence obtained by methods suited to
quantitative sequences by quantification of the labels are not
invariant to permutation of the labels contrary to the test described here.
